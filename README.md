# product-demand-forecast
This project uses real-world manufacturing demand data to forecast future product demand with time series and machine learning models.

ðŸ“¦ Product Demand Forecasting

ðŸ“Œ Project Background

In manufacturing and supply chain management, demand forecasting helps companies:

- Reduce inventory stockouts & overstocking

- Optimize production & inventory planning

- Improve supply chain efficiency & customer satisfaction

ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Analyze historical data - demand trends and seasonality

- Build multiple forecasting models

- Compare model performance with error metrics

- Visualize actual vs forecasted demand - to support inventory and production decisions

ðŸ“Œ Dataset

- Kaggle: Historical Product Demand.csv

- Dataset from a manufacturing company with footprints globally

- 4 central warehouses to ship products within the region it is responsible for.

- Sample Fields: Product_Code, Warehouse, Product_Category, Date (to receive), Order_Demand (single order quantity)

ðŸ“Œ Skills

- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Database: SQLite
