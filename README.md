# product-demand-forecast
This project uses real-world manufacturing demand data to forecast future product demand with time series and machine learning models.

üì¶ Product Demand Forecasting ***In-Progress

üìå Project Background

In manufacturing and supply chain management, demand forecasting helps companies to:

- Reduce inventory stockouts & overstocking

- Optimize production & inventory planning

- Improve supply chain efficiency & customer satisfaction

üìå Objectives

- Analyze historical data - demand trends and seasonality

- Build multiple forecasting models

- Compare model performance with error metrics

- Visualize actual vs forecasted demand - to support inventory and production decisions

üìå Dataset

- Kaggle: Historical Product Demand.csv

- Dataset from a manufacturing company with footprints globally

- 4 central warehouses to ship products within the region it is responsible for.

- Sample Fields: Product_Code, Warehouse, Product_Category, Date (to receive), Order_Demand (single order quantity)

üìå Skills

- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Database: SQLite

- Machine Learning & Time Series Forecast Models

- Visualization: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn

üìå Steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning & EDA**

  - Load dataset

  - Clean + Aggregate

  - EDA & Initial visualization

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Train/test data split (Time-based)**

  - Train: 2011 - 2015

  - Test: 2016

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Baseline Models**
  
  - Naive Forecast, Moving Average, Holt-Winters Models Forecast

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Machine Learning Models**

  - Prophet, XGBoost
  
  - Feature engineering (lags + rollings)

  - Time series Cross-Validation & hyperparameter tuning

  - Retain best config on 2011 - 2015, forecast 2016

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Models Evaluation**

  - Calculate MAE, RMSE, MAPE for each model
    
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Export to CSV**  

  - For analysis and visualization: Model_Evaluation_Results.csv

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Visualization**

- Error Metrics Comparison published on Tableau:

  [View Models Evaluation](https://public.tableau.com/views/ModelsEvaluationErrorMetrics/DashboardModelsEvaluation?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

- The errors metric are currently high for all models

- Optimization: Aggregate sales by Product_Category instead of Product_Code, smoothing outliers by z-score

- The improved Error Metrics published on Tableau:

  *** This 2016 forecast is based on actual data (optimistic 2016 forecast: close to actuals, but unrealistic)

  *** Another 2016 forecast is generated based on predicted data (realistic 2016 forecast: flatter, similar to 2017+ where actual data is not available)
