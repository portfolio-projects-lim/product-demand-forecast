ðŸ’¡ Product Demand Insights (2011 - 2016)

ðŸ”Ž Sales & Demand Trends

- Demand was lowest in 2011, spiked in late 2011/early 2012 (Nov 2011 - Feb 2012), peak in 2015.

- Top 20 products contributed to ~50% of total sales

- Category_019 dominates demand: 19 out of top 20 products came from this category

- Most orders are small size demand (0-1000k units)

ðŸ”Ž Warehouse / Geographic Distribution

- Warehouse J is the top-performing region, handling the highest volume of demand & sales

- Geographic spread indicates that demand is not evenly distributed.
  Warehouse strategy plays a crucial role in supply planning.

- Warehouse J dominates Category_019's demand and the box (IQR) is tall - big variation in demand.
  Both opportunity and operational risk.

ðŸ”Ž Return Impact

- Product_0319 had the highest return rate (>80% of sales returned)

- Product_0366 showed an unusual return event on 2011-12-23 in Warehouse S.
  
    => Category_030 recorded a return rate of ~320% in 2011 (returns exceeded sales in that year)

    => Warehouse S overall return rate on 2011 ~9.3%, much higher than other region

- Excluding this specific unusual return rate:

    => High-return rate categories (~30%):
  
        Category_027 (2015 - 2016)

        Category_009 (2011)

    => Moderate-return rate categories (~10% - 20%):

        Category_006, 018, 022 (2011)

        Category_010, 017, 029 (2014)

        Category_017, 027 (2015)

    => Warehouse A consistently showed slightly higher return rates (~1% - 2%)

ðŸ”– Potential Risk:

- Over-reliance on one category (019) and one warehouse (J) creates concentration risk.
  If demand in Category_019 or operations in Warehouse J are disrupted,
  it could impact overall sales heavily.

- Unusual Return for Product_0366 on 2011-12-23 in Warehouse S.

- Recent years higher return rate (~30%): Category_027 (2015 - 2016)
  
ðŸ”– Strategic focus:

- Category_019 and Warehouse J drives demand:
  
    Invest more category/warehouse-specific forecasting accuracy, marketing, production planning.
  
    Since Category_019 demand is massive, even small % return rate might be large.
